# OpenGL Forest Scene/Game
This project is a 3D forest and campfire viewing experience. It showcases also highlights the techniques: edge detection, texture animation and wireframes. This project was created ontop of the forest scene I made earlier in the year, to complete the scene giving it elements of gamification and new advanced shading tequniques.

I believe it is a unique experience, as there are not many environmental OpenGL games where you can toggle and see areas in the same state throughout the seasons. The inspiration came from camping in the woods when I was younger, and I think it tells a story to be able to hop between different time periods.

## User Interaction
In this scene, look around a dark forest or stay by the campfire and enjoy sky gazeing. Explore the campfire throughout the 4 seasons and see what goes on.

### Controls
To look around the scene you can use standard mouse and keyboard controls + shift for faster movement
- TAB: cycle between seasons
- W: forward
- A: left
- S: backwards
- Left Shift: move faster
- F: toggle wireframe mode
- mouse: rotate camera

### How to open the executable
To execute the program, please navigate to the x64/Debug directory. Within this directory, you'll find the COMP3015 coursework 2.exe executable file. Run this file to start the application, ensuring that all necessary resources are located within the same folder for proper operation.
